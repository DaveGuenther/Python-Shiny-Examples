# shiny_examples
Collection of small shiny examples to accomplish specific goals for my own reference and for anyone else who may benefit.

## Usage
Each example has a requirements.txt file.  Use this to build a virtual environment in that example folder to run the example:
```
python -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate   # ./.venv/Scripts/activate for windows machines
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
